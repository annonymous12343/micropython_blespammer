# micropython_blespammer
This is a micropython code made using ubluetooth for spamming numerous devices with popups like apple, android and windows. The blespamm was fixed in all recent ios and android versions, it works but not like before. On ios devices it advertises only once till the screen is turned on and off. This code was made and tested on an esp32 but it would probably work on other boards which support bluetooth and run micropython.
